# BEM Introduction

## Basic knowledge
BEM - Blocks Elements Modifiers

### Block
Standalone entity that is meaningful on its own — a component.

### Element
 part of a block that has no standalone meaning and is semantically tied to its block — can’t be moved around the page arbitrarily.

### Modifier
A flag on a block or element that represents a different state or version of the block. Use them to change the component’s appearance or behavior.

## Guidelines
